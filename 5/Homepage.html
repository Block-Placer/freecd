        <p>Radios are electronic devices that receive signals sent through the air as radio waves and turn them into sound. They are used to listen to music, news, weather reports, and talk shows. Radios work by picking up signals from broadcasting stations through an antenna and converting them into audio that we can hear. They have played an important role in communication for many years, especially before the internet and television became common. Even today, radios are still useful for entertainment, emergency alerts, and connecting people around the world through news and information.</p>
