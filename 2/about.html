  <!-- About AI Assistants -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>About AI Assistants</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants are digital tools that can understand and respond to human language. Some popular AI assistants include <b>ChatGPT</b>, <b>Gemini</b>, <b>Siri</b>, and <b>Copilot</b>. These programs are trained on large amounts of text to help them understand questions, explain ideas, and even write stories or solve problems.</p>
    <p>AI assistants use something called <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b> which helps them understand meaning, tone, and intent in our words. They are used in schools to help students with homework, in offices for writing and scheduling, and even at home for everyday tasks like reminders and translations.</p>
    <p>Although AI is becoming more advanced, it still depends on humans for guidance. It can make mistakes or give outdated information, so learning how to use AI responsibly is very important. This is what <b>Learn AI Smartly</b> helps students understand.</p>

  <!-- Life Before and After AI -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Life Before and After AI</h2>
    <div class="compare">
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Before AI</h3>
        <p>Before Artificial Intelligence became common, students and workers depended mostly on books, teachers, and manual research. Writing essays or reports took a lot of time, and finding information required reading through many pages or visiting libraries.</p>
        <p>People had to remember schedules and make decisions without any digital help. Communication was slower, and learning new skills meant attending physical classes or workshops.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h3>After AI</h3>
        <p>AI has made learning and working faster and easier. Students can now ask AI for explanations, get help with difficult topics, and even test their knowledge with AI-based tools. AI can help people write, translate, or summarize content in seconds.</p>
        <p>At the same time, it reminds us to think carefully and check what we read, because AI can be wrong. Using AI wisely helps people learn better and use technology safely.</p>
