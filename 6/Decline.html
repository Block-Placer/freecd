    <h1>The Decline in 2D Animation</h1>

      <p>
        2D animation, which used to be hand-drawn frame by frame, is slowly disappearing. Most studios now make 3D animated movies using online tools like CGI, and the special charm of 2D animation is being lost. Because of this, many children today don’t get to experience the creativity and imagination that hand-drawn movies offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Studios often avoid 2D animation because it takes more time, costs more money, and needs skilled artists. According to Kshitij Vivan Institute, 2D animation helps kids develop creativity and understand stories better because of its artistic freedom, exaggerated characters, and imaginative storytelling. It can also be more emotional and easier to follow than 3D animation.

      <p>
        In addition, The Los Angeles Times says that streaming platforms like Netflix and Prime Video prefer showing 3D animated films, while traditional 2D ones are being removed because of audience demand and production costs. This makes it harder for families to watch 2D movies together.
      </p>

      <p>
        The decline of 2D animation is not just about old movies—it’s about losing a form of art that inspires imagination and emotion for future generations.
